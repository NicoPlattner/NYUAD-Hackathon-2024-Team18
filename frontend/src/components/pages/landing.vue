      <h1>Floods</h1>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Floods are a natural disaster caused by the overflowing of water onto land that is normally dry. They can be incredibly destructive, leading to loss of life, property damage, and environmental disruption.</p>
      <h1>Causes of Flood</h1>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <li>Heavy Rainfall: This is the most common cause of floods. </li>
        <li>Storm Surge: Coastal areas are particularly susceptible to flooding due to storm surges.</li>
        <li>Rising Sea Level: Rising sea level due to climate change is gradually increasing the baseline water level in coastal areas. </li>
      </ul >
      <h1>Features</h1>
      <p>Flood forecasting is the process of predicting the occurrence, magnitude, timing, and duration of floods in a specific area, often by analysing various hydrological, meteorological, and environmental factors using Quantum Computer. The primary goal of flood prediction is to deliver timely and accurate information to decision-makers, empowering them to take appropriate actions to mitigate the potential consequences of flooding on human lives, property, and the environment. </p>
